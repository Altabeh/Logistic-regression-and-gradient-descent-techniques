# Logistic-regression-and-gradient-descent-techniques
We solve a linear logistic regression problem using optimization by gradient descent methods

This code trains a logistic regression classifier using batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. 

Decision boundary comparison for the random dataset created in the code:

)

The performance comparison shows that minibatch in general happens to have better accuracy and tends to 
be faster than the other two.
